			<h1>Stories</h1>
			<h2>Idk, this is kinda  scrapped story</h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Onii-chan.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I hear Chiiko's voice calling me. I
			quickly snap out of my dream of the past.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;What, what?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Just as we walk into a clearing on
			the hillside, Chiiko stops and points to the east.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;I think that's what I sensed
			earlier.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I turn my head to look in the
			direction. Over the mountainside I see a giant cloud seemingly
			sucking
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">all the light around it, producing a
			dim dark purple glow over the whole east side of the sky. Ever so
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">slowly approaching us. Inside it
			thousands of sparks, a beast of electricity throwing lightning in all
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">directions.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In confusion I ask: &quot;What... is
			that?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;The Last General.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Chiiko answers with a terrified
			look.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;The last what?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I have no idea what is that supposed
			to be but when even Chiiko is worried...</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;According to the legend...&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Chiiko grabs my hand and starts
			running. As we pick up the pace she begins explaining.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;... there was a secret weapon
			being developed during the war. However the world has come to an
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">end before the scientists had the
			chance to finish it. It is believed that after seeing that there is
			no
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">hope for victory, the last remaining
			general of the defending forces tried launching the weapon and
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">got consumed by it in the process.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She slows down into a walk to grab a
			breath.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Now he is doomed to forever
			linger inside it, watching it kill the people he swore to protect.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She breaks into run once again,
			pulling me with her.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">We run up the hill for maybe five
			minutes before I release Chiiko's hand and stop to yell.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Wait! Aren't we supposed to be
			running downhill to avoid it? We're going to be right in the middle
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">of the storm if we go up!&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;There is no avoiding it, we
			need to reach the lookout to have a place to hide in.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;But how is that going to be
			enough to protect us from a storm like this?!&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;This is more than just a
			storm, it's a weapon. Let's go, onii-chan! Trust me on this one.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I've heard this line few times
			before and I admit that she ended up being right every single time.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Chiiko indeed knows a lot of things
			about this world, I wonder how long she's been traveling through
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">these lands before I met her.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I give in and nod.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">And so we continue running up the
			hill. Chiiko's long pink hair flowing in the air as the wind starts
			to</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">pick up. I'm slightly lagging
			behind, able to observe this beautiful sight. I wish I could forget
			why we
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">are running away and just chase this
			girl for the chance to comb her hair after we exhaust ourselves
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">and lay in the soft grass. We would
			just rest there till the evening, watching the sun set into the
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">distant hills. Just like it always
			happens in manga. Maybe it would be the day of our first kiss...</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Need a break?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I snap back into reality as Chiiko
			interrupts my fantasies. Feeling a bit embarrassed realizing she is
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">the person I just had these thoughts
			about, I look to the ground and just murmur &quot;I'm fine&quot;
			under my
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">breath as I sprint past her.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She completely stops in her steps,
			confused, but a moment later resumes her jog.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><a name="_GoBack"></a>After few
			hours we arrive at our destination. A square two story building made
			out of concrete that
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">seems to have survived for
			centuries. The weather tried weakening it a lot as you can see the
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">corroded steel reinforcement grid
			exposed at several parts of the wall, but the whole structure seems
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">to be holding strong. The entrance
			is missing a door, just two corroded steel plates lying on the
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">ground. The windows are also missing
			any panels, those seems to have been broken ages ago.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">As we step inside, the first thing I
			notice is a set of steep spiral stairs leading to the second floor.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Along the walls there are four sets
			of long stone tables with benches, attached to the ground. On the
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">opposite side a small podium just a
			step above the floor level.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I get a nostalgic feeling,
			reminiscent of some manga I must have read when I was a kid. But I
			cannot
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">recall the name or even what it was
			about. Just this vivid image of children visiting a lookout with</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">their parents, a small band playing
			bizarre instruments to entertain everyone. Maybe some festival
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">activities of a nearby town. This
			vision is however quickly disturbed by the upsetting view of the
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">reality.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Where are young boys these day going
			to get their first kiss. Lookouts and observatories in manga
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">were always the place of romance,
			young couples sneaking up there after the sunset on the last day of
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">a festival. Stars watching them as
			they hold hands. Stars that are still there to this day but nobody
			can
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">see, locked behind a layer of never
			ending grey cloud, a ruined atmosphere probably lethal to anyone
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">getting up there. Wishes of wings to
			fly into the clouds, ambitions to go above them in hope to one
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">day reach the stars - now turned
			into fear and a desire to stay as far as possible from them, to hide
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">inside steel bunkers deep
			underground. How is anyone supposed to find romance in such position...</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Let's check the upper floor.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Chiiko says as she approaches the
			stairs. I drop my bag near the podium and walk towards there too.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Actually you go first...&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She looks at me while holding her
			skirt.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Oh... I wasn't even thinking
			about that, I swear I wouldn't have looked.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Alone with a cute girl like
			me, who knows what devil would possess you if you had the
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">opportunity~&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She teases me with a mischievous
			look.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Cute girl, cute panties...
			what would I do indeed...&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I murmur quietly, but making sure
			she can still hear it.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Just go!&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She says and pushes me towards the
			stairs with both hands.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Ok, ok. I'm going.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I quickly walk up to the second
			floor. The roof there is completely missing, exposing a dark sky
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">above us. A large veranda with iron
			railing is overlooking a valley to the west. I approach closer to
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">look down and through the fog I can
			see a shape of what seems to be a ruined town.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;We'll look tomorrow, the view
			should be clear by then.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Chiiko says as she steps besides me,
			looking into the valley.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;But for now... let's go down.
			I have to prepare.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I shoot last glance down the hill,
			almost as a rain check to someone or something. But no sign of
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">reply comes back.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I nod in agreement, head towards the
			stairs and start walking down.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;So how are we going to hide
			from that thing here?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I ask and look over my shoulder. But
			it's already too late when I realize something important...</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">First I notice Chiiko's smooth legs
			and for some reason I can't avert my eyes and look even further.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She is indeed wearing pure white
			panties...</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;I will show you w... w... &quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I slowly rise my head to meet her
			gaze and a feeling of guilt fills my mind.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;... where the hell are you
			looking, onii-chan?!&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She stops and covers them with her
			skirt. Her face is completely red, I have to say something.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Eeh... I mean... you know...
			you said you will show me so I looked!&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Perfect excuse!</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;You looked before I even said
			anything! And I was definitely not talking about this... Why would
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">you defile me like this?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Or maybe not...</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;What, defile? I mean... I'm
			sorry... I...&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I'm really not sure if she is being
			serious or not right now.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Just move already!&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">As she says that I realize that I
			stopped in the middle of the staircase without even knowing.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Something about that view was so
			mesmerizing that I lost the sense of reality.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I quickly jump down the remaining
			stairs and wait for Chiiko to walk down before looking at her
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">again. From here I watch her unpack
			some ground sheets from my bag. She takes one of them,</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">spreads it on the ground and sits
			down without saying a word.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I need to cover the entrance, the
			wind is already picking up and we can't stay here with the doors
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">open like this. Seeing the ground
			sheets I get an idea, I should try blocking it with a sheet, these
			are
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">pretty durable and can be used as a
			raincoat too. That might be enough. I take one of them and try to
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">attach it to the frame of the
			doorway.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Damn... Just stay there!&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I talk to the sheet as it keeps
			sliding down when I try to push it between the exposed reinforcements</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">of the building.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Can you fetch me some of the
			tent nails?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I call to Chiiko who is still
			sitting in the middle of the room.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;That's not necessary, leave
			this to me. Come closer to the center&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;But... uuh, ok...&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I try to object at first, but
			remembering the times she was right and seeing her confident face now
			is
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">enough for me to trust her. I follow
			her instructions and approach the center.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">As I come closer, she takes a
			kneeling posture and begins some kind of ritual. Fingers entwined,
			she
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">pusher her hands to her chest and
			closes her eyes. I have no idea what is happening but all I can do is
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">keep quiet and watch.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">After a short moment, the area
			around her chest starts to glow with a faint blue light, almost like
			a
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">smoke flowing out of her body. It
			doesn't take long and the whole center of the room is filled with
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">this aura, slowly but surely
			expanding.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">As the light reaches me and envelops
			my whole body, I suddenly feel a calm and relaxed atmosphere,
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">as if all the problems of the world
			suddenly disappeared.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;SSSSbhooooo!&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Out of nowhere a loud supersonic
			noise cracks the peaceful moment as a bright blue wave of energy
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">comes out of Chiiko's hands, pushing
			her body to the ground as she loses balance.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Chiiko!&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I scream as I run to help her. The
			blue aura abruptly returns back to her chest and the room turns dark.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Sliding down near her I try to pick
			up her body and rest it in my lap.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Uuuh...&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A weak sound comes from her mouth.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Are you alright!?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;I'm... I'm fine onii-chan.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Are you hurt?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;No, really, its fine. It
			doesn't hurt&quot;
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She says with a bit more confidence
			in her voice.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;What was that aura, what
			happened?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;I underestimated the power and
			lost my concentration. I need to do it to protect us, going to try
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">again now.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Wait! Can you explain first?
			What are you doing?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;I'll tell you after this
			onii-chan, please trust me for now, we don't have much time&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Just if you can...&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She looks at me with embarrassed
			face while getting up from my embrace.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;... if you can onii-chan,
			please support me and hold my body in place.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She resumes her kneeling posture and
			rests her back against my chest, relaxing a bit.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I hug her around the waist and
			felling very nervous I ask:</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Like this?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She grabs my hands and tightens my
			grasp even more. My heart is racing, about to jump out of my
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">chest if it continues like this. She
			can surely feel it but still remains calm.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Yeah... don't let me go...&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She says, entwines her fingers and
			once again pushes against her chest. I try to compose myself a bit
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">and focus on my task. After few
			seconds she gets really stiff and I can feel her shaking. I try to
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">reinforce my hold even more, I must
			not let her go. A short moment later the familiar blue light starts
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">flowing out, spreading lightly into
			the room. She is twitching in my arms but I manage to hold her in</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">place. I don't remember seeing her
			move like this when she did it a moment ago. Most likely because
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I was dumbfounded from all the stuff
			happening to even notice.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">As the light reaches the walls of
			the room, a new shade of blue light starts emitting from Chiiko's
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">chest. This one is a bit darker and
			seems more compressed. In a thick beam, it flows towards the
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">windows, the doorway and the
			staircase, forming a glass-like field and filling the holes leading
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">outside of this room.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Once all the windows and cracks are
			shielded with this forcefield, the light blue aura that covers the
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">whole area moves away from the
			center and forms a soft layer on the walls and the ceiling of the
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">room. And with that Chiiko stops
			trembling and relaxes in my embrace, releasing a big sigh of relief.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Mmm...hmmm&quot;.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She lies down in my lap, breathing
			shallowly.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;There we go, that should do
			it.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She whispers quietly.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">At that moment I realize that
			everything went completely silent, any sounds of wind whispering
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">through the trees or flowing through
			the cracks in the walls is gone. I try to listen for a while but
			there
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">is nothing to be heard. Even the
			occasional howling of wild animals is no longer there, just the sound
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">of our breathing and rustling of
			clothes as we move.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Was that magic?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I interrupt the silence.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Uum... some people call it
			magic, but the term I use is World Hack.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Chiiko says as she raises from my
			lap to face me properly.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;World Hack?&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Yes, it is when I inject
			excess energy into the world to add a desired effect.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Chiiko starts explaining.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;The world is defined by the
			energy that operates it, that goes from like atomic level to levels
			that our
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">mind is not even able to properly
			comprehend, energy that is not measurable and similar stuff.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Me and other 'magicians', as
			you would call us, don't need to understand that either as we don't</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">really touch any of that.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;The way World Hack works is
			not dependent on the energy of the world but on the energy I can
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">create and put into the world,
			simulating the energy of the world. That way I am not changing
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">anything, I am simply adding a layer

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><span lang="es-ES">&quot;kuu uu ku

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She can't even hide the giggling...</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;............. whatever.... I

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I can't help but to smile at this
			point. I am suddenly reminded of the thought I had earlier today when
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">we were running up the hill, how
			peaceful that moment was and how much I wanted to just be in that
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">fantasy world and forget everything
			else. And now here we are, in probably the most peaceful
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">moment since I had to leave the
			bunker. A weaponized storm or whatever it might actually be is
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">raging outside right now, yet we are
			safe in this building, protected by Chiiko's magical field.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">No sound of the outside can be
			heard. Just the frequent flashes of light reflecting on the thick
			blue
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">barrier are what gives away that
			there is something actually happening out there.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Yet... we can still be safe in here,
			I can still enjoy this moment, a cute girl sleeping in my lap. It
			feels
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">like I have everything I wanted, at
			least for today. I have no idea what is going to happen tomorrow, I
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">don't even know where we are headed
			in the first place. But all that seems so... irrelevant now.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Chiiko's long hair is spread across
			the ground sheet, forming a carpet just like fallen cherry blossoms
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">that I have read so much about but
			never seen. Perhaps one day we can view such sight, lay down in
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">there and relax just like now.
			Chiiko would probably blend with all the pink there, becoming
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">practically invisible. I remember
			one last thing from today's fantasy. I burrow my fingers into her
			hair
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">and stroke it, gently combing it as
			the strands of her hair slowly flow through the spaces between my
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">fingers. It is so soft... how does
			she even keep it so clean, my hair is always a mess...</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">&quot;Mmmm~&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Chiiko releases a satisfied noise as
			I stroke her hair for the second time. I am no longer sure if she is</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">awake or not but it doesn't stop me.
			I keep combing it for a short while, gradually slowing down after</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">each stroke. And with a pleasant
			feeling in my heart I eventually lose consciousness...</p>
